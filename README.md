## ApoptosisFluo.ijm
This is a script for imageJ that detects cell nucleii stained with DAPI/Hoechst and creates ROI's for each nucleous present in the field of view. It then measures the average intensity of a secondary channel in the ROI's. For the publication this script was used to detect the presence of the CellEvent caspase-3/7 apoptosis detection reagent.
This script is designed to work with the micrscopy setups present in our lab and is not standardized for other experiments.
